        <p>Ada Lovelace was the daughter of the noted poet <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lord-Byron-poet">Lord Byron</a> and Annabella Milbanke Byron. Their marriage lasted little more than a year, and Ada never met her father. To counteract the "dangerous" mental tendencies of Ada's father, Annabella emphasized music, French, and mathematics in her daughter's studies. This last subject particularly appealed to Ada.</p>
